Nasu is a spritesheet and nametable editor created to help us design and assemble the assets of our famicon games. It can import and export both .chr spritesheets and .asm nametables. To change the palette color, use the [theme ecosystem files](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes).

The application was initially created for internal use, but was later made available as a free and open source software. You can use this application directly in your [browser](https://hundredrabbits.github.io/Nasu).
